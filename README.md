# Quantitative Economics Assignments & Projects  

This repository contains codes for assignments and projects from the Quantitative Economics course. This advanced course is designed for PhD students to develop proficiency in quantitative, computational, and numerical methods used in micro- and macroeconomics.  


## Overview  

The course covers key quantitative techniques, including economic modeling, estimation, optimization, and simulation-based methods. The repository provides code implementations in **Python** for practical learning and application.  

## Topics Covered  

- **Economic Modeling & Estimation**  
  - Structural vs. reduced-form estimation  
  - Optimization techniques  
  - Dynamic vs. static choices  

- **Simulation-Based Methods**  
  - Monte Carlo methods, MCMC  
  - Bayesian estimation, bootstrap  

- **Discrete & Continuous Choice Models**  
  - Logit, Probit, Nested Logit, Mixed Logit, BLP  
  - Applications in international trade models  

- **Dynamic Programming & General Equilibrium**  
  - Value function & policy function iteration  
  - Single-agent and heterogeneous-agent models  
  - Recursive equilibrium models  

- **Approximation & Optimization Techniques**  
  - Taylor & polynomial approximation  
  - Log-linearization, numerical optimization
